## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

The desktop view of the solution is a grid with the first item spanning two columns.

![Mobile view](./assets/single-price-grid-mobile.png)

The mobile view spans all the items to fill the 2 column desktop grid.  I am currently contemplating whether mobile first or desktop first is a better option.  I've been using mobile first, but I somehow feel it's easier to make changes to suit the mobile view than the other way around, as the desktop view has the most complexity.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

As explained above, I use a simple 2 column grid and span the mobile view rather than changing the grid layout.

### What I learned

This was a good practice round for using grid.  I didn't learn anything new, but it was a good challenge.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Cheatsheet](https://grid.malven.co/) - A nice summary of how the results look for each option when you use grid.
